LIBRARIES AND PYTHON VERSION:
This code was written and tested on the lab machines using Python 3.4.8.
Libraries used that are not installed by default: sklearn, pandas, numpy, tensorflow
Also please note the keras version used is 1.2.2 (which is pretty old) since I could 
not get any newer versions working on the lab machines.

HOW TO RUN:
Code assumes a testsets.py and evaluate.py file is present (not supplied in the zip)
Code assumes nltk data is present in the path /modules/cs918/nltk_data/
Code assumes training data exists in the same folder as the code (included in the zip)
Codes assums the svm.pkl file also exists in the same folder (also included in zip),
otherwise it will train the svm model again which can take very long (multiple hours!!!).

Other than that the code will always train the naive bayes model and the CNN as they
do not take very long to train and run (about 3 minutes total running time with the 
3 test sets).
